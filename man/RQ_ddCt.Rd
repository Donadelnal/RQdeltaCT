\arguments{
\item{data}{data object returned from delta_Ct() function.}

\item{group.study}{character: name of study group (group of interest).}

\item{group.ref}{character: name of reference group.}

\item{do.tests}{logical: if TRUE, statistical significance of delta delta Ct values between compared groups will be calculated using Student's t test and Mann-Whitney U test. Default to TRUE.}

\item{save.to.txt}{logical: if TRUE, returned table with results will be saved to .txt file. Default to FALSE.}

\item{name.txt}{character: name of saved .txt file, without ".txt" name of extension. Default to "RQ_expCt_results".}
}
\value{
Data.frame with relative quantification results.
}
\description{
Performs relative quantification of gene expression using 2^(-ddCt) method.
}
\details{
This function calculates:
* Means (return in columns with "_mean" pattern) and standard deviations (return in columns with "_sd" pattern) of delta Ct values of analyzed genes across compared groups.
* Normality tests (Shapiro_Wilk test) of delta Ct values of analyzed genes across compared groups and returned p values in columns with "_norm_p" pattern.
* Differences in mean delta Ct values of genes between compared groups, obtaining delta delta Ct values (in returned "ddCt" column).
* Fold change values (return in "FCh" column) together with log10 Fold change values (return in "log10FCh" column).
  Fold change values are calculated for each gene by exponentiating ddCt values using 2^-ddCt formula.
* Statistical testing of delta delta Ct values (differences between study group and reference group).
  Student's t test and Mann-Whitney U test are implemented and resulted statistics (in column with "_test_stat" pattern) and p values (in column with "_test_p" pattern) are returned.
